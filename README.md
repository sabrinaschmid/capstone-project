## Tasty Travel

Tasty Travel is my very first mobile app which I developed during a three month web development bootcamp at [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/).

The app, which is made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), helps people with food intolerances when travelling abroad to navigate their way through the jungle of unknown food. In the restaurant, the user can use a search function to quickly and easily check which dish is suitable for his individual food intolerance. He also receives helpful translations, pictures and a list of ingredients. He can then make an informed decision or alternatively choose another dish.

You can check out the mobile app [here](https://capstone-project-aaa24.firebaseapp.com/) (currently only available in German).

If you want to make sure that you are using the latest version please use the following instructions:
