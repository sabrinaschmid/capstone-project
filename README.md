# Tasty Travel

**Tasty Travel** is my very first mobile app which I developed as my final project of a three month web development bootcamp at [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/).

The app, which is made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), helps people with food intolerances when travelling abroad to navigate their way through the jungle of unknown food. In restaurants, the user can use a search function to quickly and easily check which dish is suitable for their individual food intolerance. The app delivers helpful translations, pictures and a list of ingredients so that the user can make an informed decision on their meal.
